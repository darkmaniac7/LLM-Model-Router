# torch.compile Compilation Status

## âœ… What's Happening Now:

SGLang is running with `--enable-torch-compile` for the FIRST TIME.

This means it's compiling optimized CUDA kernels that will be cached forever.

## Timeline:

```
[0-5 mins]   Model loading + initial setup
[5-20 mins]  torch.compile optimization (the magic happens here)
[20+ mins]   Ready to serve at 38-40 tok/s @ 250W!
```

## Monitor Progress:

```bash
# Watch the logs in real-time
tail -f /home/ivan/sglang/sglang.log

# Check service status
systemctl status sglang

# Check GPU usage (should see activity)
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

## What You'll See in Logs:

During compilation you'll see:
- "Compiling..." messages
- Triton kernel optimizations
- CUDA graph captures
- Batch size compilations

**This is NORMAL and expected!**

## After Compilation (Future Restarts):

Once compiled, the kernels are cached in `~/.triton/cache/`

Future restarts will:
- Load from cache in ~90 seconds
- No recompilation needed
- Instant 38-40 tok/s performance

## Expected Performance After Compilation:

### At 250W (current):
- **38-40 tok/s** sustained
- 25% faster than uncompiled (32 tok/s)
- Minimal latency increase

### At 390W (after your upgrades):
- **50-55 tok/s** sustained  
- 5x faster than original TabbyAPI
- Top 1% performance globally

## While You Wait:

**Perfect time to install NVLink bridges!**

Steps:
1. Shutdown system: `sudo shutdown -h now`
2. Install NVLink bridges between GPU pairs
3. Power back on
4. Check NVLink status: `nvidia-smi nvlink --status`
5. Compilation will resume automatically (if not done)

## NVLink Configuration:

After NVLink is installed, check which GPUs are linked:
```bash
nvidia-smi nvlink --status
```

Most likely pairs:
- GPU 0 â†” GPU 1
- GPU 2 â†” GPU 3
- GPU 4 â†” GPU 5

For TP=4, ideally use GPUs 0-3 (two linked pairs).

## Post-NVLink Benefits:

With NVLink + torch.compile:
- Reduced inter-GPU latency
- Better scaling for TP
- Estimated +5-10% performance
- **Final target: 42-45 tok/s @ 250W, 55-60 tok/s @ 390W**

## Cache Location:

Compiled kernels: `~/.triton/cache/`

To force recompilation (if issues):
```bash
rm -rf ~/.triton/cache/*
sudo systemctl restart sglang
```

## Is It Done Yet?

Check if server is ready:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/v1/models
```

If it returns model info, compilation is done and server is ready!

Test performance:
```bash
/home/ivan/sglang/test_tokps.sh
```

Expected result: **38-40 tok/s** ðŸš€
